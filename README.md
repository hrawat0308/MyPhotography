# Photography Website

This is a small Photography Website. I have created this Website using HTML, CSS , CSS-Grid only.

This website mainly contains 4 sections:

* Header Section
* Animals Images Section
* Mountains Images Section
* Beaches Images Section 

Link to the last 3 sections is given in Header section, also a user can scroll down to these section.



## WHY this project was chosen?

Many of my friends are into photography and I've always wondered why many people doesn't think of photography as a full time career.

I've seen my friends so passionate about photography and every time they learn new photography techniques they show it to everyone in their social media profile.

I thought of creating this website as it is very professional for a photographer to have its own photography website. They can show their best captures, get businesses and do much more to their website.

## HOW did you make the project?

I've used HTML to structure the website. CSS to style the website and CSS-GRID to layout the website.
This website is created using VS CODE editor. This project doesn't include any database and working with API's.

Below is the link to this website which is hosting using Netlify :

## WHAT features, technical things you had implemented?

As this project was created just using HTML and CSS there isn't much interaction with user and no dynamic functions are included. 
The main focus was to style the project properly so it looks like a photograpy website.

It includes header section, which includes a logo and link to other section of the webpage. A simple hover effect is applied on these links. 
This header section is included in a container section which consists of a nice photograpy thought and a banner image.
I've also used CSS Media Queries so that it can be viewed properly on almost every screen size. Behaviour of this website has been made responsive using CSS Media Queries.

The other 3 photograpy sections includes images of Mountains, Beaches and Animals with each section starting with a photograpy quote. Each photograph has a shadow box, which helps them to stand out from other elements of the webpage.
Every Image has a title, which appears when mouse pointer is moved over an image.
